Glynx - a download manager. 

INSTALLATION

  WINDOWS:

	- unzip to a directory, such as c:\glynx or c:\temp
	- this is a command prompt script, it will not work properly 
	if you double click it.
	However, you can put it in the startup directory in "slave mode" 
	making a link with the --slave parameter. 
	Then open another command prompt window to operate it as a client. 
	- the latest ActivePerl has all the modules needed, 
	except for "https://".

  UNIX/LINUX:

	tar -xzf Glynx-[version].tar.gz
	chmod +x glynx.pl                 (if necessary)
	pod2html glynx.pl -o=glynx.htm	  (this is optional)

	- under RedHat 6.2 I had to upgrade or install these modules:
	HTML::Tagset MIME:Base64 URI HTML::Parser Digest::MD5 libnet
	libwww-perl

	- to use https you will need:
	openssl (www.openssl.org) Net::SSLeay IO::Socket::SSL

    Please note that the software will create MANY files in 
    its work directory, so it is advisable to have a dedicated 
    sub-directory for it.


How do I run Glynx?

Before you run Glynx, you should be connected to
the Internet. 

Glynx can then be run by typing 'perl glynx.pl [options] http://...' 
in a command prompt or terminal window.


How to create a default configuration:

	Start the program with your command-line options, plus --cfg-save
	or:
 	Start the program with --cfg-save, then edit glynx.ini file.


Proxy, Firewalls

	1.Add the setting HTTP_proxy, with your proxy name as the
	value (you must include "http://" ), followed by a colon
	and the proxy port, if applicable; e.g., "http://proxy:8080" 

	2.If you require a user name and/or password to access your
	proxy, add the settings HTTP_proxy_user and
	HTTP_proxy_pass, with your user name and password as the
	respective values. 

	It is also possible to use an FTP proxy. See the Net::FTP
	documentation.
