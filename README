Glynx - a download manager. 

INSTALLATION

    Windows:
	- unzip to a directory, such as c:\glynx or c:\temp
	- this is a command prompt script, it will not work properly 
	if you double click it.
	However, you can put it in the startup directory in "slave mode" 
	making a link with the --slave parameter. 
	Then open another command prompt window to operate it as a client. 
	- the latest ActivePerl has all the modules needed, 
	except for "https://".

    Unix/Linux:

	tar -xzf Glynx-[version].tar.gz

	- under RedHat 6.2 I had to upgrade or install these modules:
	HTML::Tagset MIME:Base64 URI HTML::Parser Digest::MD5 libnet
	libwww-perl

	- to use https you will need:
	openssl (www.openssl.org) Net::SSLeay IO::Socket::SSL

    Please note that the software will create MANY files in 
    its work directory, so it is advisable to have a dedicated 
    sub-directory for it.


How do I run Glynx?

Before you run Glynx, you should be connected to
the Internet. 

If your Internet connection is via a
firewall or proxy, you should set the
environment variable 'HTTP_proxy' to the name
of this proxy server. If your proxy server
requires a username and password, the
environment variables 'HTTP_proxy_user' and
'HTTP_proxy_pass' should be set to these
values.

Glynx can then be run by typing 'perl glynx.pl [options] http://...' 
in a command prompt or terminal window.


How to create a default configuration:

	Start the program with your command-line options, plus --cfg-save
	or:
 	Start the program with --cfg-save, then edit glynx.ini file.
